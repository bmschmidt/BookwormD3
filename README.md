D3 Bookworm
===========

This is my attempt to build a fully d3-based Bookworm browser. Rather than re-implement the line charts that Martin Camacho made for the primary Bookworm repo, I've tried to get a constantly updated model working with alternate visualizations of the data: here, for instance, a map and a grid plot.
